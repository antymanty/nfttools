# nfttools
A suite of scripts for calculating and analyzing the rarity scores of NFTs in a given collection on the Ethereum blockchain. The scripts retrieve NFT metadata, calculate rarity scores based on attributes, and output the results in a structured format.

# NFT Rarity Score Calculator and NFT Metadata Retriever

This repository contains three scripts:

1. `retrieveNFT.js`: This script connects to the Ethereum blockchain, retrieves metadata for each NFT in a given collection, and saves the metadata to a JSON file.

2. `calculate_rarity.js`: This script reads the JSON file generated by `retrieveNFT.js`, calculates rarity scores based on the attributes of each NFT, and saves the rarity scores to a new JSON file.

3. `tool.js`: This script is the main entry point for the application. It orchestrates the other two scripts and outputs the final rarity scores.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/antymanty/nfttools.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the dependencies: npm install
   
## Usage

1. Open `tool.js` and set the contract address to the address of the ERC721 contract for the NFT collection you want to analyze.
2. Run the tool: node retrieveNFT.js, node calculate_rarity.js or node tool.js depending on which tool you want to use
3. The tool will output a JSON file in the `Rarity_zkSync` directory. This file contains the rarity scores for each NFT in the collection.
